title: Introduction to Subjecto
---

## Motivation

Why another state management library?

**Subjecto** started as a pet project which needed to respond to the following personal requirements:

- no (or extremelly low) learning-curve
- small API foot-print
- based on the observable pattern
- configurable / extensible
- debugging and inspecting of data updates should be easy
- framework agnostic
- no dependencies

## Stage

Subjecto is still in active development. You should expect some breaking changes.

## For who is it

Subjecto is a good fit for small to medium size/complexity stores it can get you up and running in minutes.

## Credits

Subjecto is heavily inspired by [RxJs' BehaviorSubject](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/subject#behaviorsubject) behavior and API.
